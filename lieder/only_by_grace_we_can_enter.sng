Only by grace can we enter,

only by grace can we stand.

Not by our human endeavor,
d                       G4 G
but by the blood of the Lamb.
e                      G    a
Into your presence you call us,
    F          G4 G
you call us to come.

Into your presence you draw us
    d           F        C    a
and now by your grace we come,
d           F        C     G
now by your grace we come.
