A            D     E                 D     A
All heav'n declares the glory of the risen Lord.
           D   E                D      A
Who can compare with the beauty of the Lord?
                D E                  A     E fis
Forever He will be the Lamb upon the throne.
                 D   E7                A
I gladly bow the knee and worship Him alone.

A         D    E                 D     A
I will proclaim the glory of the risen Lord.
             D    E             D      A
Who once was slain to reconcile men to God.
                 D E                  A     E fis
Forever You will be the Lamb upon the throne.
                 D   E7                A
I gladly bow the knee and worship You alone.
