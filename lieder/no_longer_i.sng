At the cross, at the cross,
        Hsus
where I first saw the light,
        H7                       E
and the burden of my soul rolled away.
       A                  E
It was there by faith I received my sight,
    Hsus      H                E
now no longer I, but Christ in me.

Ref.: I will run to the cross,
          A            E
where you opened up my eyes,
       H                     A     E
I will sing of the love that saved me,
       H
I will bow in the place,
           A               E
where your death became my life.
       H           A          E
I will run, I will run to the cross.

O how ^endless the hope,
o how ^empty the grave,
and the ^joy of a stone rolled a^way.
It is ^there by grace, I am ^raised to life,
now ^no longer ^I, but Christ in ^me.
