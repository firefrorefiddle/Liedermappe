Over all the earth, you reign on high,
      E4      D             E4     fis7
every montain stream, every sunset sky.
       E4    D               E4   h7
But my one request, Lord, my only aim,
              D        E4  A
is that you'd reign in me again.

over all my dreams, in my darkest hour
    E       D       E     h7
You are the Lord of all I am,

cause you mean ^more to ^me than any ^earthly ^thing.
So won't you ^reign in ^me a^gain!
