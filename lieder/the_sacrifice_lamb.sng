^The prophets of ^old^ ^speak much of mes^siah, his death is
fore^told^ the ^purpose is ^clear. Isiah did ^say’^t ^was for an
a^tonement to give us the ^way^ that ^leads not to ^death.

^So brothers of ^mine^ look ^not to your^selfs. For we are but ^one^,
^we all need his ^help. We’ve broken the ^law^, ^but he paid our
^debt that we can find ^life^ in ^Jeshua’s ^death.

Ref.: ^The sacrifice ^lamb has been ^slain his blood on the ^altar a ^stain
to wipe away ^guilt and ^pain and bring hope e^ternal.
So final a^tonement has ^come and brought us new ^hope through God’s ^son.
If you will be^lieve in your ^heart Jeshua you will ^know.
