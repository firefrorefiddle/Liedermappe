G/C       C/F             G/C
Whom have I in heaven but Thee?
             a/d
And there is none upon earth
         D/G          G/C
that I desire besides Thee.

   D/G                G/C
My heart and my flesh faileth;
    h/e                       C/F
but God is the strength of my heart,and 
   G/C        C/F D/G G/C
my portion fore---e---ver.
