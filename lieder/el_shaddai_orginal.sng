Ref.: El Shaddai, El Shaddai, El Elyonna Adonai
       B                     E
Age to age, Youâ€™re still the same
       a     G      A
By the power of the name
       d           G         C        F
El Shaddai, El Shaddai, Erkamka na Adonai,
        B                   G            C
We will praise and lift you high, El Shaddai.

             d                    G
Through your love and through the ram,
              C          F
you saved the son of Abraham. 
            B             E
Through the power of your hand,
           a     G      A
turned the sea into dry land.
       d              G
To the outcast on her knees,
             C              F
you were the God who really sees.
    B                  G                 C
And by your might, you set your children free.

Through the ^years you made it ^clear,
that the ^time of Christ was ^near.
Though the ^people couldn't ^see,
what Mes^siah ^ought to ^be.
Though your ^word contains the ^plan,
they just ^could not under^stand.

                  B                G
Bridge: Your most awesome work was done,
            B               G4 G
Through the frailty of your son.
