The sun comes up, it's a new day dawning,
G            D         A     h
it's time to sing your song again.

Whatever may pass, and whatever lies before me,
G         D                A4 A    D     D4 D
let me be singing when the evening comes.

You're ^rich in ^love, and you're ^slow to ^anger,
your ^name is ^great, and your ^heart is ^kind.
For ^all your ^goodness I will ^keep on ^singing,
^ten thousand ^reasons for my ^heart ^to ^find.^^

And ^on that ^day when my ^strength is ^failing,
the ^end draws ^near and my ^time has ^come.
^Still my ^soul will sing your ^praise un^ending,
^ten thousand ^years and then for^e^ver^more.^^
