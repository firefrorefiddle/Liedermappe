enter'd our world, your glory veil'd.

and give your life, that we might live.

^And in the ^garden of ^tears
^my heavy ^load he ^chose ^to ^bear. 
^His heart with ^sorrow was ^torn.
“^Yet not my ^will, but ^Yours”, ^he ^said^.

^Come, see his ^hands and his ^feet,
^the scars that ^speak of ^sa^cri^fice.
^Hands that flung ^stars into ^space,
^to cruel ^nails sur^^ren^dered^.

^So let us ^learn how to ^serve
^and in our ^lives en^thr^one ^him.
^Each others ^need to pre^fer,
^for it is ^Christ we’re ^^ser^ving^.
