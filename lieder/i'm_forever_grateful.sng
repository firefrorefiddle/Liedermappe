    G                           C
You did not wait for me to draw near to you,
        D                     C           G
But you clothed yourself with frail humanity.
                               C
You did not wait for me to cry out to you,
        D                C     D       G
But you let me hear your voice calling me.

    C           D           G
And I'm forever grateful to you
C           D        C       G
I'm forever grateful for the cross,

I'm forever grateful to you,
         A7      a        D        G
That you came to seek and save the lost.
