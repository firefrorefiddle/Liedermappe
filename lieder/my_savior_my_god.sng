I am not skilled to understand,
                                  cis/e
what God has willed, what God has planned.
                         H/D
I only know at his right hand,
                     E/G
stands one who is my savior.

                           
I take him at his word and ^deed,                              
Christ died to save me this I ^read.                         
And in my heart I find a ^need,                 
for him to be my ^savior.

                                         A/C
Ref.:   That he would leave his place on high 
                                   E/G
        and come for sinful man to die.
                                          H/D
        You count it strange, so once did I,
                         E/G
        before I knew my savior.

                  cis/e            A/C
Ref.:   My savior loves, my savior lives
                    E/G              H/D
        My savior's always there for me
                  cis/e          A/C
        My God he was, my God he is
                    E/G          H/D
        My God he's always gonna be (2x)
                                         
                           
Yes, living, dying; let me ^bring                                
My strength, my solace from this ^spring
That he who lives to be my ^king
Once died to be my ^savior
