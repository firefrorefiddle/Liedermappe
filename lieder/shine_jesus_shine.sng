^Lord, I ^come to your ^awesome ^pre^sence,

^search me, ^try me, con^sume all my ^darkness.
^Shine on ^me, ^Shine on ^me!

^As we ^gaze on your ^kindly ^bright^ness
^so our ^faces dis^play your ^like^ness.
^Ever ^changing from ^glory to ^glory,
^mirrored ^here may our ^lives tell your ^story.
^Shine on ^me, ^Shine on ^me!
