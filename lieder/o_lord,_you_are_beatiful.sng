Oh Lord, you’re beautiful,
     D       G   D A
your face is all I seek,
    h         Fis      G  A    D
for when your eyes are on this child
     G     D A         G
your grace a-bounds to me.

Ref.: I want to take your word and shine it all around,

but first help me just to live it Lord,
             G D   e          G     A            Fis
and when I’m doing well, help me to never seek a crown,

for my reward is giving glory to you.

Oh ^Lord, please ^light ^the ^fire,
that ^once burned ^bright ^and ^clear,
re^place the ^lamp of ^my ^first ^love,
that ^burned ^with ^holy ^fear.
