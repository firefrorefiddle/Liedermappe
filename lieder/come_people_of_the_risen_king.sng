One heart, one voice;-- oh, Church of Christ, rejoice!

^Come, those whose joy is ^morning ^sun,
and those ^weeping ^through the ^night.
^Come, ^those who tell of ^bat^tles ^won,
and those ^struggling in the ^fight.
For his ^perfect love will ^never change,
and his ^mercies ^never ^cease,
^but ^follow us through ^all ^our ^days
with the ^certain hope of ^peace.

^Come, young and old from ^ev'ry ^land,
men and ^women ^of the ^faith.
^Come, ^those with full or ^emp^ty ^hands;
find the ^riches of his ^grace.
Over ^all the world his ^people sing;
shore to ^shore we ^hear them ^call
^the ^truth that cries through ^ev^'ry ^age:
''Our ^God is all in ^all''
